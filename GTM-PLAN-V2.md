# CaseGlide Unified Go-To-Market Plan

**Version 2 — February 17, 2026**
**Wes Todd (CEO) + Claude Automation**
**Confidential**

---

## Executive Summary

This plan updates the CaseGlide Unified GTM from February 11, incorporating five significant changes: the addition of a Promoter Marketing Campaign targeting industry media and influencers, integration of the Litigation Sentinel platform (Newsletter, Executive Briefing SaaS, Council SaaS, and Trial SaaS) as conversion destinations, CaseGlide website control as a managed channel, Pipedrive pipeline activation with HubSpot historical mining, and a meeting preparation workflow that leverages Claude to produce prospect-specific addendums for every scheduled demo.

Steve Kiernan's engagement concludes March 1. His final-week deliverables (credential transfers, Industry Media Target List, Pipedrive handoff, knowledge base) remain on the timeline outlined in the Transition Plan. After March 1, Wes and Liana Rodriguez (VP Client Operations) own all prospect meetings, with Claude providing research, addendum generation, and rehearsal support.

The primary objective remains unchanged: determine whether Fortune 500 corporate legal departments and insurance companies represent viable growth markets for CaseGlide.

## What Changed from v1

Promoter Marketing Campaign added (podcast outreach, trade publications, guest posts). Litigation Sentinel Newsletter becomes the audience holding bin. CaseGlide website becomes a managed channel. Pipedrive pipeline reactivation and HubSpot data mining added. Meeting Prep workflow added (Pipedrive + calendar scan → prospect-specific addendums). Claude Code/Chat automation expanded across all channels. Steve departs March 1 — all GTM execution shifts to Wes + Claude.

---

## 1. Team Structure & Time Allocation

After March 1, the GTM is a two-entity operation: Wes (strategy, executive selling, content, meetings) and Claude (automation, execution, research, reporting, meeting prep).

### 1.1 Wes Todd — CEO (10 hrs/week on GTM)

| Day | Block | Activities |
|-----|-------|------------|
| Monday | 3 hrs (Deep Work) | Signal scan review, LinkedIn post drafting, InMail personalization review, weekly campaign metrics |
| Wednesday | 3 hrs (Outreach) | Send approved InMails, publish LinkedIn post, respond to DMs, review Promoter Campaign responses |
| Thursday | 2 hrs (Optimize) | Review Apollo sequence performance, adjust targeting, approve new enrollments |
| Friday | 2 hrs (Plan) | Weekly report review, next week priorities, meeting prep for upcoming demos |

Prospect meetings (demos, briefings, partnership calls) are scheduled as needed and are Wes's highest priority. Liana Rodriguez drives the product demo; Wes handles positioning, FUD framework, and close.

### 1.2 Liana Rodriguez — VP Client Operations

Liana owns the product demonstration during prospect meetings. She drives the software live while Wes narrates the business case. Her responsibilities:
- Drive all live software demos (McDonald's case, Docket Dashboard, Precedent Dashboard)
- Participate in demo rehearsals before major meetings
- Provide product-level answers during Q&A
- Support Council and Trial program delivery for converted prospects

### 1.3 Claude (Chat + Code + Chrome) — Automation & Meeting Prep

- **Apollo:** List building, sequence enrollment, engagement monitoring, CSV exports, Pipedrive deal creation
- **LinkedIn:** Post engagement tracking, target-title engager identification, Thought Leader Ad boost triggers
- **Sales Navigator:** Weekly signal scans (job changes, profile views, buyer intent), InMail draft preparation
- **Pipedrive:** Deal creation from engaged contacts, stage updates, form submission monitoring
- **Promoter Campaign:** Draft outreach emails to media targets, track responses, schedule follow-ups
- **Meeting Prep:** Scan Pipedrive and calendar for upcoming demos → produce prospect-specific addendums
- **Reporting:** Weekly dashboards across all channels
- **Website:** Content updates, SEO optimization, landing page alignment

### Meeting Prep Workflow

When a demo or briefing is scheduled, Claude scans Pipedrive for deal context and the calendar for timing, then produces:
1. An attendee research brief
2. A prospect-specific addendum to the core demo script covering custom positioning, anticipated questions, and close strategy
3. Competitive intelligence where relevant

---

## 2. Steve Kiernan Transition (Through March 1)

Steve's engagement concludes March 1. His remaining deliverables are documented in the Transition Plan (separate document). Key items:

| Due | Deliverable |
|-----|-------------|
| Feb 23 | All platform credentials and admin access transferred to wesley@caseglide.com (Apollo, Pipedrive, Leadpages, LinkedIn Campaign Manager, WordPress, HubSpot) |
| Feb 23 | Billing verified on CaseGlide company card; LinkedIn ads paused |
| Feb 25 | Email forwarding active (skiernan@ → wesley@); knowledge base materials shared |
| Feb 28 | Industry Media & Influencer Target List (podcasts, trade pubs, newsletters, influencers, conferences, warm connections) |
| Feb 28 | Pipedrive pipeline review with deal-by-deal handoff notes |
| Mar 1 | Final day. All access confirmed transferred. |

After March 1, the campaign infrastructure Steve built (Apollo sequences, LinkedIn retargeting architecture, Leadpages, Pipedrive pipeline) is maintained and expanded by Wes + Claude.

---

## 3. Campaign Architecture

The GTM runs four parallel campaigns feeding two conversion destinations.

| Campaign | Channel | Audience | Destination |
|----------|---------|----------|-------------|
| A: Volume Engine | Apollo email sequences | 3,500+ F500 legal & insurance contacts | Executive Briefing landing page |
| B: Precision Engine | Sales Nav InMail + LinkedIn organic | 50–100 hand-selected executives | Executive Briefing landing page |
| C: Promoter Marketing | Email outreach to industry media | Podcast hosts, trade pubs, influencers | Litigation Sentinel Newsletter |
| D: LinkedIn Ads | Retargeting + direct response | Email engagers + matched audiences | Executive Briefing landing page |

### 3.1 The Funnel

All campaigns ultimately feed into a single pipeline:

**Industry Exposure (Promoter Campaign) → Litigation Sentinel Newsletter (Holding Bin) → Executive Briefing (Qualification) → CaseGlide Council (Paid 90-Day Program) → CaseGlide Trial (Full Experience)**

Campaigns A, B, and D drive directly to the Executive Briefing. Campaign C drives to the Newsletter first, building an owned audience that receives ongoing exposure to CaseGlide's thought leadership and offers.

### The Holding Bin Strategy

The Litigation Sentinel Newsletter is not a content marketing project. It is a holding bin. Every subscriber is a prospect who raised their hand but isn't ready for a briefing yet. The newsletter keeps CaseGlide top of mind and gives us permission to market the Executive Briefing, Council, and Trial to an engaged audience repeatedly without burning the cold outreach channel.

---

## 4. Campaign A: Volume Engine (Apollo)

Inherited from Steve's campaign, upgraded with Campaign 1 messaging. Steve's email engagement validated the channel: 16.7% open rate, 12.1% click rate. Zero conversions because the landing page sold the wrong thing (Council instead of Executive Briefing). We fix the destination, upgrade the copy, and let volume work.

- **List:** 3,500+ contacts after cleaning. F500 GCs, CLOs, CROs, VP Risk, VP Claims, Chief Claims Officers.
- **Sequence:** 5-touch email over 14 days. Sells the executive conversation, never the software.
- **CTA:** Executive Briefing landing page (rebuilt with Campaign 1 messaging).
- **Automation:** Claude Code enrolls batches, monitors engagement, exports engaged contacts to Pipedrive.

### 4.1 Email Sequence Structure

| # | Day | Hook | Core Message |
|---|-----|------|--------------|
| 1 | 1 | The case everyone knows, the lesson no one applied | Portfolio drift is invisible until it's expensive. Offer executive briefing. |
| 2 | 3 | Where outcomes actually get set | Outcomes decided before mediation. Negotiation gaps. Which firms push vs drift. |
| 3 | 6 | The questions boards ask | Boards ask exposure, direction, top 3 interventions. Info trapped in emails/PDFs. |
| 4 | 9 | What early visibility changes | Visibility is the most expensive failure mode. Severity hardens. |
| 5 | 14 | Next step or close the loop? | Polite close. Yes/no. Permission to stop if not relevant. |

**Rule:** These emails sell the executive conversation, never the software. No feature dumps. No screenshots. No pricing.

---

## 5. Campaign B: Precision Engine (LinkedIn + Sales Navigator)

High-touch, high-conversion channel. 42% conversion from InMail to qualified conversation from initial test.

### 5.1 Sales Navigator InMails

- **Volume:** 10–15 personalized InMails per week to hand-selected executives.
- **Targeting:** Job changes at target accounts, profile viewers, buyer intent signals, new GC/CLO hires.
- **Process:** Claude Code prepares draft InMails with personalized first lines. Wes reviews and sends.

### 5.2 LinkedIn Organic (3x/week)

Wes's personal LinkedIn profile is the credibility engine. Posts create air cover so outbound doesn't feel random. Content pillars: litigation intelligence insights, nuclear verdict trends, CaseGlide thought leadership.

Engagement signals feed Sales Navigator: anyone with a target title who engages gets a personalized InMail within 48 hours.

---

## 6. Campaign C: Promoter Marketing (NEW)

Generate industry exposure through collaborations with podcasts, trade publications, newsletters, and influencers reaching F500 corporate legal and insurance leadership.

### Why Promoter Marketing Now

We built four assets that give us something to promote: the Litigation Sentinel Newsletter, Executive Briefing SaaS, CaseGlide Council SaaS, and CaseGlide Trial SaaS. Wes isn't pitching software on podcasts — he's discussing litigation intelligence as a framework. The newsletter gives every collaboration a landing destination.

### 6.1 Target Categories

- **Corporate Legal Podcasts:** Shows targeting GCs, CLOs, corporate legal leadership.
- **Insurance/Claims Podcasts:** Shows targeting VP Claims, CCOs, litigation managers.
- **Trade Publications & Newsletters:** Digital and print covering litigation management, legal tech, InsurTech.
- **Industry Influencers:** LinkedIn influencers, conference speakers with followings among our target audience.
- **Conferences:** 2026 events where CaseGlide can present, sponsor, or participate.

### 6.2 Outreach Workflow

Steve's Industry Media & Influencer Target List (due Feb 28) seeds the initial outreach. After March 1, Claude maintains and expands the list and automates outreach:

| Step | Owner | Action |
|------|-------|--------|
| 1 | Claude | Maintain and expand media target list. Research new podcasts, publications, influencers. |
| 2 | Claude | Draft personalized outreach emails for each target. |
| 3 | Wes | Review and approve outreach. Send warm intros personally. |
| 4 | Claude | Send approved cold outreach. Track responses. Schedule follow-ups. |
| 5 | Wes | Conduct interviews, write/review guest posts, speak at events. |

### 6.3 Pitch Angles

- "Where Nuclear Verdicts Actually Start" — the gap between risk emerging and leadership seeing it
- "The Questions Boards Are Asking About Litigation" — what F500 boards actually want to know
- "Why Your E-Billing System Is Lying to You" — spend data vs. outcome data
- "The AI Opportunity in Litigation Management" — real value vs. hype
- "Defense Counsel Performance: What the Data Shows" — evidence-based counsel management

Every collaboration drives to the Litigation Sentinel Newsletter as the CTA.

## 7. Conversion Destinations: Litigation Sentinel Platform

The Litigation Sentinel platform serves as CaseGlide's conversion engine. Four components, each serving a different buyer journey stage.

| Component | Stage | Purpose | URL |
|-----------|-------|---------|-----|
| Newsletter | Awareness / Holding Bin | Capture prospects. Ongoing exposure. Permission to market repeatedly. | litigation-sentinel.vercel.app/ |
| Executive Briefing | Qualification | 30-min SaaS + meeting. Assess maturity & interest. | /briefing |
| Council | Paid Engagement | 90-day consulting + data transformation. Identify ROI. | /council |
| Trial | Full Experience | 10 hardest cases in CaseGlide. Experience the full platform. | /trial |

The Newsletter is the priority for completion and launch. It is the holding bin that makes every other campaign more effective.

---

## 8. Campaign D: LinkedIn Ads

- **Thought Leader Ads:** Boost Wes's organic posts exceeding 2% engagement. Run from personal profile.
- **Direct Response Ads:** Dedicated creative driving to Executive Briefing page from CaseGlide company page.

**Targeting:** GC, CLO, CRO, VP Risk, VP Legal, Deputy GC. Seniority VP/CXO/Director. 1,000+ employees. Retail, Logistics, Insurance, Energy, Entertainment, Food Service. US only.

**Retargeting:** LinkedIn Insight Tag on caseglide.com + Leadpages. Google Display on non-converters. Apollo list as matched audience.

**Budget:** $1,500/month to start. Scale if cost-per-briefing stays below $500.

---

## 9. New Initiatives

### 9.1 CaseGlide Website Control

The CaseGlide website (caseglide.com, WordPress) needs to become a managed channel aligned with GTM messaging:
- Confirm admin access to WordPress for wesley@caseglide.com
- Audit current site content for alignment with Litigation Intelligence positioning
- Update homepage messaging to match GTM voice (drift, intervention, governance — not features)
- Executive Briefing CTA prominent on every page
- Litigation Sentinel Newsletter signup on the site
- LinkedIn Insight Tag and Google Analytics installed

### 9.2 Pipedrive Pipeline Reactivation

- Audit all open deals: stage, last activity, recommended next step
- Create deals for engaged Apollo contacts not yet in Pipedrive
- Standardize stages: Newsletter Subscriber → Briefing Scheduled → Briefing Completed → Council Proposed → Council Active → Trial → Contract
- Claude maintains Pipedrive after meetings: notes, next steps, stage updates

### 9.3 HubSpot Historical Data Mining

CaseGlide used HubSpot for 8+ years. That data contains contacts who previously engaged positively, historical deal data, and campaign performance. Not an immediate priority but worth accessing to identify warm re-engagement targets for Apollo and LinkedIn.

### 9.4 Meeting Prep Workflow

When a demo or briefing lands on the calendar, Claude executes a standard prep sequence:

| # | Action |
|---|--------|
| 1 | Scan Pipedrive for deal context: who is the prospect, what stage, prior interactions, any notes from outreach |
| 2 | Check calendar for meeting time, attendees, and any linked materials |
| 3 | Research attendees: LinkedIn profiles, roles, tenure, any published content or speaking history |
| 4 | Research the prospect company: current litigation management approach, tech stack signals, public filings, relevant news |
| 5 | Produce a prospect-specific addendum to the core demo script: custom opening, positioning emphasis, anticipated questions, close strategy |
| 6 | Deliver addendum + research brief to Wes for review before the meeting |

---

## 10. Landing Pages

### 10.1 Executive Briefing Page (Primary CTA)

Single conversion destination for Campaigns A, B, and D.
- **Headline:** "Your Litigation Portfolio Is Telling You Something. Are You Hearing It?"
- **What This Is:** A 30-minute executive briefing on where drift starts, where severity forms, and what governance looks like.
- **What This Is Not:** Not a demo. Not a sales pitch. Not a product walkthrough.
- **Who It's For:** GCs, CLOs, and CROs at companies with 100+ litigated matters in retention.
- **CTA:** "Request Executive Briefing" → Pipedrive deal → Wes follows up within 24–48 hours.

---

## 11. Claude Code Master Prompt

Updated master prompt for Claude Code sessions:

```
CAMPAIGN CONTEXT:
- CaseGlide sells Litigation Intelligence to F500 GCs, CLOs, CROs, VP Claims

- Wes + Liana own all meetings. Claude provides meeting prep (addendums, research, rehearsal support)

RULES:

### The May 31 Decision Point

By end of May, we should have enough data from all four campaigns to answer the core question: are Fortune 500 corporate legal and insurance viable growth markets for CaseGlide? The metrics that matter: Executive Briefings completed, Council programs proposed, conversion rates by channel, and pipeline value.
