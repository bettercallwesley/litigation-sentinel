## Segment 1: Welcome & Introductions (0:00–1:30)

| Time | Who | Screen | Script |
|------|-----|--------|--------|
| 0:00 | Wes | PPT: Title Slide — CaseGlide logo, meeting title, date | Thank you for making the time today. I'm Wesley Todd, CEO of CaseGlide, and with me is Liana Rodriguez, our VP of Client Operations. Liana works directly with our clients every day to transform how they manage litigation. |

Today we're going to show you something specific. We're not going to walk through a feature list. Instead, we're going to show you a real case — one you already know — and demonstrate exactly how CaseGlide changes what you can see, when you can see it, and what you can do about it.

We'll keep the product portion to about 15 minutes, and then open it up for questions.

---

## Segment 2: Where Nuclear Verdicts Actually Start (1:30–3:00)

| Time | Who | Screen | Script |
|------|-----|--------|--------|
| 1:30 | Wes | PPT: Problem Slide — 3 stat callouts on nuclear verdict trends | (see below) |

Before we get into the product, let me set the frame. Most people think nuclear verdicts come from bad facts. They don't. They come from bad timing.

The case that turns into a $50 million verdict almost always starts as a case that someone thought was defensible. The facts looked manageable. The attorney said it was under control. And then something shifts — a deposition reveals prior incidents, a negotiation window closes, a mediation gets postponed — and by the time leadership sees the risk, the outcome is already locked in.

That gap — between when the risk becomes real and when someone with authority sees it — is where outcomes actually get decided. And in most organizations today, that gap is filled with email threads, quarterly attorney reports, and PDFs that nobody reads until it's too late.

> **FUD:** Every portfolio has at least one case that FEELS defensible today but could look indefensible in six months. The question is: do you know which one?

**TRANSITION:** "Let me show you exactly what that looks like. Most of you have heard of the McDonald's hot coffee case..."

---

## Segment 3: The McDonald's Hot Coffee Case — Product Demo (3:00–14:00)

*Wes narrates the story. Liana drives the software. The goal: show CaseGlide's product components through a case every executive has heard of, proving CaseGlide surfaces risk early enough to act.*

### 3A. Setting the Stage (3:00–4:30)

| Time | Who | Screen | Script |
|------|-----|--------|--------|
| 3:00 | Wes | Liana opens CaseGlide → Liebeck v. McDonald's case snapshot | (see below) |

Most people think the McDonald's hot coffee case is a punchline. But for anyone managing a litigation portfolio, it's the most instructive case study in claims history. Not because of the facts — but because of the decisions, and when they were made.

In our demo, this is Stella Liebeck vs. McDonald's. Plaintiff counsel is Saul Goodman. Defense is Chuck McGill at Pearson Specter Litt. We've used memorable names, but the underlying fact pattern is the real case.

McDonald's and their counsel said: defensible. She spilled coffee on herself. Millions of people drink our coffee every morning. Low-value case, try it, win on liability.

On February 27, 1992, Stella Liebeck, 79 years old, was a passenger in a parked car. No cup holders. Coffee between her knees. She removes the lid, spills the full cup into her lap. Third-degree burns. Eight-day hospitalization. Skin grafts.

### 3B. The Negotiation Failure (4:30–6:00)

| Time | Who | Screen | Script |
|------|-----|--------|--------|
| 4:30 | Wes | Liana clicks to Negotiation Table in CaseGlide | (see below) |

Before it became a media circus, it was a straightforward ask. Liebeck tried to resolve it for roughly $20,000 to cover medical expenses. McDonald's responded with $800.

That negotiation gap is the earliest warning signal in the case. And in most organizations, that gap lives in an email between the attorney and one adjuster. Nobody in leadership sees it. Nobody intervenes.

> **FUD:** How many cases in your portfolio right now have a negotiation gap like that — where the demand and the offer are so far apart that the only path forward is a courtroom?

| Time | Who | Screen | Script |
|------|-----|--------|--------|
| 5:15 | Wes | Liana shows Plan Meeting notes (deposition observations) | (see below) |

Then the case turns. Defense counsel reports the plaintiff presented very well at her deposition. She's sympathetic. She's credible.

And discovery turns a 'coffee spill' case into a policies and procedures case. McDonald's coffee was held at 180 to 190 degrees. At that temperature, a third-degree burn happens in under three seconds.

### 3C. The Point of No Return (6:00–8:00)

| Time | Who | Screen | Script |
|------|-----|--------|--------|
| 6:00 | Wes | Liana navigates to Insured Meeting notes — deposition prep findings | (see below) |

Here's the moment that locked in the outcome. During deposition prep for the McDonald's store manager, defense counsel discovered there had been over 700 prior coffee burn complaints over a decade. Seven hundred.

And the store manager was dismissive. Sometimes rude. When that testimony goes on the record, the case is no longer about one spilled cup of coffee. It's about a corporation that knew and chose not to act.

Once those facts are on the record, outcomes are no longer negotiated. They're forecasted. The plaintiff attorney has everything they need for punitive damages. And the settlement window that existed three months earlier? Gone.

> **FUD:** Once the facts are on the record, outcomes are forecasted, not negotiated. The leverage your team had yesterday doesn't exist tomorrow. CaseGlide surfaces cases before they cross the line of no return.

### 3D. What CaseGlide Makes Visible (8:00–11:00)

| Time | Who | Screen | Script |
|------|-----|--------|--------|
| 8:00 | Wes | Liana navigates to Chronicle (AI Case Timeline) | (see below) |

This is where CaseGlide changes the equation. In the real world, those risk signals — the negotiation gap, the strong plaintiff deposition, the 700 prior complaints — are scattered across emails, PDFs, and attorney phone calls. Nobody has the complete picture.

In CaseGlide, the case is a governed record. Let me introduce the tools that turn scattered information into executive intelligence.

| Time | Who | Screen | Script |
|------|-----|--------|--------|
| 8:30 | Liana | Chronicle — scroll through AI timeline, pause at key entries | (see below) |

This is Chronicle — CaseGlide's AI case timeline. Chronicle builds an authoritative timeline of every case in minutes. Every case update, negotiation, and milestone — organized chronologically.

I can see the deposition prep note, the discovery of 700 prior complaints, and the negotiation gap, all in one view. What used to require reading a 50-page file is visible in 30 seconds.

| Time | Who | Screen | Script |
|------|-----|--------|--------|
| 9:30 | Liana | Open Chambers → Query: "Summarize this case for a supervisor meeting tomorrow" | (see below) |

This is Chambers — CaseGlide's AI case intelligence. I can ask plain-English questions about any case.

Watch what comes back. This answer used to require a 30-minute call with outside counsel. Now any case manager or litigation leader gets it in seconds.

| Time | Who | Screen | Script |
|------|-----|--------|--------|
| 10:15 | Liana | Chambers query: "Why could this case result in a nuclear verdict?" | (see below) |

This is the question that matters most for board-level risk conversations. Chambers pulls from the full case record and surfaces the exact factors that created nuclear verdict exposure.

> **FUD:** Imagine walking into a board meeting and being asked: 'Are we exposed right now?' Today, most legal departments can't answer that confidently. With CaseGlide, you can answer it for every case in your portfolio.

| Time | Who | Screen | Script |
|------|-----|--------|--------|
| 10:45 | Liana | Chambers query: "What strategies did defense counsel take to avoid a nuclear verdict?" | (see below) |

Chambers doesn't just show you the risk — it shows you what was done about it and what could still be done. This is decision support for litigation leadership.

### 3E. The Decision That Saved the Outcome (11:00–12:30)

| Time | Who | Screen | Script |
|------|-----|--------|--------|
| 11:00 | Wes | Liana returns to Case Snapshot | (see below) |

When you can see these signals early — the negotiation gap, discovery turning against you, the manager who's going to be a terrible witness — you can intervene while intervention still matters.

Before that store manager's deposition locks 700 prior complaints into the record, defense counsel pushes to settle. You trade a potential nuclear verdict for a controlled resolution. The outcome gets decided by strategy, not by surprise.

CaseGlide surfaces cases before they cross the line of no return.

> **FUD:** The only thing worse than picking the wrong strategy is discovering the risk too late to act.

### 3F. Bridge to Portfolio View (12:30–14:00)

| Time | Who | Screen | Script |
|------|-----|--------|--------|
| 12:30 | Wes | PPT: Bridge Slide — "From One Case to Your Entire Portfolio" | (see below) |

The McDonald's case is one case. But general counsels and VPs of claims don't manage one case. They manage hundreds. Sometimes thousands.

Are we exposed right now? Is that exposure getting better or worse? If we intervene in three places this quarter, where does it change outcomes?

Most organizations cannot answer those consistently because the truth lives in email threads and the memory of outside counsel. CaseGlide makes it visible.

> **FUD:** Now imagine this isn't just one McDonald's case. It's five. But right now, without the right data and visibility, no one knows which of those five will define your year.

---

## Segment 4: Docket Dashboard — Your Portfolio Right Now (14:00–17:00)

*Uses the demo data: 1,000 open cases with Dewey (problem firm) vs. PSL (strong firm) contrast.*

| Time | Who | Screen | Script |
|------|-----|--------|--------|
| 14:00 | Liana | Docket Dashboard — no filters, ~1,000 open cases | (see below) |

This is the Docket Dashboard. Right now you're looking at roughly 1,000 open cases across the entire portfolio. Open case count, cases to watch, legal expense alerts, time since last negotiation — all real-time.

At a portfolio level, things look manageable. But the power of CaseGlide is what happens when you drill down.

| Time | Who | Screen | Script |
|------|-----|--------|--------|
| 14:45 | Liana | Filter: Defense Law Firm → Dewey, Cheatem & Howe (200 cases) | Now I'm filtering to one defense firm. Watch what happens. |

| Time | Who | Screen | Script |
|------|-----|--------|--------|
| 15:00 | Wes | Dashboard refreshes — all Dewey metrics visible | (see below) |

Look at what the data tells you. Nearly half their cases are over budget. Average case age: a year and a half. 68% open more than a year. Two-thirds have no recent negotiation activity. 18% headed to trial.

This is a firm burning fees while cases age. They're not moving cases toward resolution. They're stuck in early discovery and billing hours.

This is exactly how nuclear verdicts happen — cases sitting in the system, unattended, until it's too late. Without CaseGlide, this pattern is invisible.

> **FUD:** Where's YOUR Dewey right now? Every portfolio has one. The question is whether you can see it before it costs you.

| Time | Who | Screen | Script |
|------|-----|--------|--------|
| 15:45 | Liana | Clear filter → Apply Pearson Specter Litt (200 cases) | Now watch the contrast. Same number of cases. Same types of claims. Same jurisdictions. |

| Time | Who | Screen | Script |
|------|-----|--------|--------|
| 16:00 | Wes | Dashboard refreshes — PSL metrics visible | (see below) |

Zero cases over budget. Average age: seven months. 57% actively in negotiations or mediations. Only 5.5% headed to trial. Three-quarters show recent negotiation activity.

This is proactive litigation management. This firm is moving cases toward resolution, keeping costs under control, staying out of the courtroom.

The data tells you exactly which firms are earning their fees and which need immediate attention. Right now, not at the next quarterly review.

## Segment 5: Precedent Dashboard — Who Do You Trust (17:00–19:00)

| Time | Who | Screen | Script |
|------|-----|--------|--------|
| 17:00 | Liana | Navigate to Precedent Dashboard — slow scroll | If the Docket Dashboard answers 'what's happening now,' the Precedent Dashboard answers 'who should handle it.' |

| Time | Who | Screen | Script |
|------|-----|--------|--------|
| 17:15 | Wes | Precedent Dashboard with firm comparison data visible | (see below) |

When you're making panel decisions, the question is: who do we trust with cases like this, in venues like this, when punitive risk is on the table?

Precedent turns closed-case history into a defensible counsel strategy. Outcomes, cycle time, and cost patterns by firm and attorney — in context, including venue and case type.

Our clients use this to compare firms on value — not just cost — and make data-driven panel decisions that reduce both defense spend and total cost of risk.

| Time | Who | Screen | Script |
|------|-----|--------|--------|
| 18:00 | Wes | Liana shows filtered comparison of two firms on same case type | (see below) |

Making panel changes won't bring results today. What brings results today is what we just showed you on the Docket Dashboard — seeing which cases are on track, off track, and where intervention changes outcomes.

Precedent tells you who to send cases to. Docket tells you what to do with the cases you have right now.

## Segment 6: The Close — How We Work Together (19:00–21:00)

| Time | Who | Screen | Script |
|------|-----|--------|--------|
| 19:00 | Wes | PPT: Recap Slide — 4 product components with icons | (see below) |

Let me recap what you saw. Through the McDonald's case: Chronicle — the AI case timeline, and Chambers — the AI case intelligence. Through the portfolio view: the Docket Dashboard for real-time portfolio intelligence, and the Precedent Dashboard for evidence-based counsel strategy.

For full disclosure, we didn't cover today: our legal spend management software — complete billing and bill review; additional APIs and integrations that feed the data engine; and our CaseGlide Council program.

| Time | Who | Screen | Script |
|------|-----|--------|--------|
| 19:45 | Wes | PPT: Partnership Slide — CaseGlide Council 90-day program | (see below) |

The way we typically work with new clients starts with the CaseGlide Council. It's a 90-day Litigation Intelligence Accelerator where our team — including Liana — works directly with your team to design workflows, migrate data, configure the platform, and train your staff and outside counsel.

The goal isn't just software implementation. The goal is transformation — moving your litigation operation from emails and memos to governed intelligence that leadership can act on.

By day 90, you have a live Docket Dashboard showing every open case, a Precedent Dashboard showing counsel performance, Chronicle and Chambers working on every file, and a team that knows how to use it.

| Time | Who | Screen | Script |
|------|-----|--------|--------|
| 20:30 | Wes | PPT: Next Steps Slide | (see below) |

Our proposed next step is to schedule an Executive Briefing — a focused 30-minute conversation where we understand your current litigation management maturity, identify the specific gaps where CaseGlide can drive immediate value, and outline a partnership scope that makes sense for your organization.

With that, I'd like to open it up for questions. Liana and I are both here to dig into anything you'd like to explore further.

## Segment 7: Q&A (21:00–25:00)

*Standard Q&A. Both Wes and Liana available. If a question requires showing something in the software, Liana navigates.*

### Key talking points for common questions:

**Q: How long does implementation take?**
A: Our CaseGlide Council program is 90 days. Most clients are live with full data in 60 days and spend the last 30 days on training and optimization. We handle data migration. Minimal IT involvement from your side.

**Q: How does the AI work? What model?**
A: Our AI is built into the platform and trained specifically for litigation intelligence. It reads only YOUR case data — it's not pulling from the internet or other clients' files. Everything is governed, auditable, and private to your organization.

**Q: What does it cost?**
A: Pricing is based on case volume and which components you need. We'll cover that in the Executive Briefing once we understand your portfolio size and priorities.

**Q: How does data get into CaseGlide?**
A: Defense counsel enter case information directly through structured Case Updates — intelligent forms built around litigation milestones. They can also drag and drop documents and CaseGlide extracts the key information. No more email-based reporting.

**Q: What if our outside counsel won't adopt it?**
A: Thousands of defense attorneys and hundreds of firms use CaseGlide daily. Attorneys prefer it because it replaces lengthy email reports with structured updates that take less time. We've never had a firm refuse to use it.
