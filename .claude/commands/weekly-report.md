Read GTM-PLAN-V3.md (V3.1 amendment). Weekly report — Friday routine.

Execute the full Friday routine:

1. WEEKLY REPORT: Comprehensive performance across all channels:
   - Apollo: total enrolled to date, this week's sends, deliverability, engagement by segment, sequence performance (which emails get opened/clicked most)
   - Newsletter: total subscribers, this week's growth, open rate, click rate, top-clicked articles
   - LinkedIn: post engagement rates, follower growth, top-performing post this week
   - Pipedrive: deals by stage, conversion rates, new deals, stale deals, pipeline value
   - Email captures: Briefing + Council + Trial form submissions
   - Recommendations and next week priorities

2. WRITE NEXT WEEK'S NEWSLETTER: Based on my topic direction (I'll provide this — if I haven't, use the top recommendation from Wednesday's content research), write the full weekly newsletter:
   - Lead article (1,000-1,500 words): Deep analysis. Use Wes's voice from docs/caseglide-master-context-memo-v2.md — opinionated, operationally grounded, slightly contrarian. Specific details, case references, implications. End with a question.
   - 2-3 shorter pieces (300-500 words each): Other current topics. Same voice.
   - Update the Litigation Sentinel website with the new articles (staged, goes live Monday)
   - Prepare the Beehiiv email version (lead article in full, shorter articles as excerpts with "read more" links)
   - Include Executive Briefing CTA mid-email, Council and Trial mentions at bottom (links to landing pages)

Show me the report and the full newsletter draft for my review. I will either approve or provide edits before Monday's send.
