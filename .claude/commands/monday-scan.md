Read GTM-PLAN-V3.md (V3.1 amendment). Monday scan.

Execute the full Monday routine:

1. NEWSLETTER SEND: If I approved Friday's newsletter draft (check my last message or assume approved if no edits noted), apply any edits and send via Beehiiv. Update the Litigation Sentinel website with the new articles. Confirm delivery.

2. APOLLO SEQUENCE UPDATE: Update the [CURRENT TOPIC] references in Emails 1 and 4 of the Apollo sequence to match this week's newsletter lead article.

3. APOLLO ENROLLMENT: Search and enroll the next batch of ICP contacts (target: 500+/week, adjust based on deliverability data). Update Pipedrive with new deals at "Newsletter Subscriber" stage.

4. ENGAGEMENT POLL: Poll all existing Apollo contacts for engagement signals (opens, clicks, replies). Update Pipedrive deal stages and engagement scores. Flag any replies for my review.

5. PIPEDRIVE REVIEW: Identify stale deals (no movement in 7+ days). Recommend actions.

6. WEEKLY REPORT: Generate the full performance report:
   - Apollo: total enrolled, deliverability (bounce/open/click rates), engagement by segment
   - Newsletter: subscribers, open rate, clicks, new signups this week
   - LinkedIn: post engagement, follower growth
   - Pipedrive: deals by stage, new this week, stale deals
   - Email captures: Briefing + Council + Trial form submissions
   - Flagged replies and high-intent contacts for my review

Show me the report and any items needing my attention.
