Read GTM-PLAN-V3.md and docs/caseglide-master-context-memo-v2.md. Meeting prep.

Research and prepare a one-page executive briefing for my upcoming meeting:

1. COMPANY RESEARCH: Research the prospect company — litigation portfolio (any public filings, SEC disclosures, major litigation), recent news, industry, size, key legal/risk executives.

2. PAIN POINT ANALYSIS: Based on their industry and profile, identify the most likely pain points from our ICP framework:
   - For GC/CLO: governance gaps, board narrative challenges, counsel strategy defensibility
   - For CRO/VP Risk: volatility, retention economics, predictability
   - For CFO: retention exposure, cash volatility, ROI defensibility

3. TALKING POINTS: Suggest 3-5 talking points tied to the CaseGlide demo narrative (see docs/caseglide-demo-script.md if available). Connect their likely pain points to our Litigation Intelligence positioning.

4. OBJECTION PREP: Based on their profile, which objections from Section 12 of the master context memo are most likely? Prepare the responses.

5. CTA RECOMMENDATION: What's the right next step to propose at the end of the meeting?

Format as a clean one-page briefing I can review on my phone before the meeting.
