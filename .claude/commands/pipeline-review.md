Read GTM-PLAN-V3.md. Pipeline review.

Pull the current Pipedrive pipeline and give me a clear snapshot:

1. DEALS BY STAGE: Count and list deals at each stage (Newsletter Subscriber → Briefing Scheduled → Briefing Completed → Council Proposed → Council Active → Trial → Contract)

2. STALE DEALS: Any deals that haven't moved stages in 7+ days. For each: contact name, company, current stage, days stale, last activity, recommended action.

3. HIGH-INTENT CONTACTS: Anyone showing multiple engagement signals (2+ email opens, clicked newsletter link, visited website, submitted a form). Recommend follow-up approach for each.

4. CONVERSION FUNNEL: What are the conversion rates between stages? Where is the funnel leaking?

5. THIS WEEK'S WINS: Any new briefings scheduled, new form submissions, notable replies.

Format as a clean executive summary I can scan on my phone.
