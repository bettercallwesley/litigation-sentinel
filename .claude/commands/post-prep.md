Read GTM-PLAN-V3.md (V3.1 amendment). Post prep — Wednesday routine.

Execute the full Wednesday routine:

1. LINKEDIN POSTS: Draft and schedule 3 LinkedIn posts via Typefully API. Follow V3.1 rules:
   - No external links in the post body (links get throttled)
   - For each post, draft the first comment: "This week's Litigation Sentinel covers this in detail: [newsletter link]"
   - Connect posts to this week's newsletter themes
   - Use voice/tone from docs/caseglide-master-context-memo-v2.md
   - End each post with a question
   Show me all 3 posts for review before scheduling.

2. MID-WEEK APOLLO CHECK: Check Apollo engagement metrics since Monday. Any new opens, clicks, replies? Update Pipedrive with new signals.

3. NEWSLETTER CONTENT RESEARCH: Research the most important litigation developments this week for NEXT week's newsletter. Focus on our content pillars:
   - Litigation funding transparency (Senate bill, state developments)
   - RICO and fraud ecosystem litigation
   - AI in courts (Florida, federal, state)
   - Nuclear verdicts and venue risk
   - Plaintiff bar tactics and scale
   For each relevant development: headline, 2-3 sentence summary, why our audience cares. Recommend which should be next week's lead article.

4. PROMOTER PITCHES: If Promoter campaign is active, draft any new media pitches. All pitches drive to Litigation Sentinel as CTA.

Show me LinkedIn posts for review, any Apollo signals, and the content research with topic recommendations.
