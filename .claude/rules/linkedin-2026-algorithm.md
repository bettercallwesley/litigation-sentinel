## The 360 Brew Algorithm (2025-2026)

LinkedIn replaced thousands of specialized ranking models with **360Brew** — a 150-billion parameter LLM trained on professional network data. This is not a tweak; it's a complete rewrite of how LinkedIn distributes content.

### How Distribution Works Now

1. **Profile-Content Alignment**: 360 Brew reads your headline, About section, experience, and skills to verify authority before distributing posts. If profile doesn't match content topic, the algorithm gets confused about who should see it.
2. **Topic DNA**: The algorithm identifies your "topic DNA" and distributes content based on demonstrated expertise rather than network size.
3. **Personalized Scoring**: It creates a temporary "personalized version" by analyzing each user's last 2-3 months of activity (many-shot in-context learning).
4. **Depth Over Width**: The era of the "Depth Score" — engagement quality matters more than reach.

### Engagement Signals (Ranked by Weight)

| Signal | Weight | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| **Saves** | Highest (3.9x impression multiplier) | 200 saves > 1,000 likes. Drives 4x reach over likes. |
| **Comments** | 15x more weight than likes | Thread depth (back-and-forth replies) > one-off comments |
| **Dwell Time** | Critical | 30+ seconds = "high-quality" classification. Avg user: 3.7 seconds. |
| **Profile Actions** | High | Profile visits, connection requests from post readers |
| **Reposts** | Medium-High | Signals "worth sharing with my network" |
| **DMs** | Medium-High | Private sharing = strong trust signal |
| **Likes** | Lowest | Minimal algorithmic impact in 2026 |

### Content Format Performance (Best to Worst)

1. **PDF Carousels** (8-10 slides) — Highest engagement. Completion rates boost distribution. Use contrast/storytelling for B2B visuals. Teach a framework, share data, or provide step-by-step process.
2. **Long-form text posts** (1,000-1,300 characters) — Outperform shorter posts via dwell time. Must be structured well.
3. **Short native video** (30-90 seconds) — Growing 2x faster than other formats.
4. **Text-only with strong hooks** — Best reach-per-follower ratio.
5. **External links** — ~60% LESS reach. Never put links in posts; use comments instead.

### The "How I" vs "How To" Framework

**"How I" posts with personal proof outperform generic "How To" by ~80% in reach.**

- BAD: "How to reduce litigation costs" (generic advice)
- GOOD: "How I helped a Fortune 500 GC cut resolution costs by 34%" (personal proof with specific data)

The formula: **"How I" + Client Win + Specific Data = Maximum Reach**

Content pillars that work:
- **Proof**: "How [Client archetype] achieved [specific result] in [timeframe]"
- **Human**: "We just hit [milestone]. Here's what I learned."
- **Contrarian**: "[Conventional wisdom] is wrong. Here's what the data shows."
- **Framework**: Step-by-step process the reader can use immediately

### Posting Cadence

- **Sweet spot**: 3-4 high-quality posts per week (not 5+ random ones)
- **Consistency matters**: Predictable posting builds engagement signals. Same days/times each week.
- **Golden hour**: First 60-90 minutes after posting determine full distribution
- **Quality > Quantity**: One valuable post/week outperforms five forgettable ones
- **90-day commitment**: Takes ~90 days of consistent, aligned posting for 360 Brew to fully categorize you

### What Gets Penalized

- Clickbait and vague storytelling
- "Comment YES" engagement bait
- Overly promotional/salesy content
- External links in post body (use comments)
- Posting just to "stay active" with low-quality content
- Generic AI-generated content without personal perspective
- Content that doesn't match profile topic alignment

### Profile Optimization for 360 Brew

Wesley's LinkedIn profile must align with content topics:
- **Headline**: Must explicitly mention content pillars (litigation intelligence, legal tech, F500 legal departments)
- **About section**: Functions as SEO — use keywords naturally
- **Experience**: Must reinforce the same narrative as posts
- **Test**: "Does this content serve the same audience that my profile describes?"

### Save-Worthy Content Patterns

Since saves are the #1 signal, every post should aim to be "reference-worthy":
- Educational frameworks readers bookmark for later
- Checklists and step-by-step processes
- Data compilations (nuclear verdict stats, industry benchmarks)
- Contrarian takes backed by evidence
- Templates and swipe files
