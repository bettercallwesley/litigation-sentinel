> Auto-loaded rule. Applies whenever Claude drafts LinkedIn posts, newsletter content, InMails, or any public-facing copy for Wesley/CaseGlide.

## Wesley's Voice Profile

Wesley Todd is the CEO/founder of CaseGlide, a litigation intelligence platform. He speaks to Fortune 500 General Counsels, CLOs, CROs, and VP Claims. His voice is:

- **Direct and confident** — States positions clearly, doesn't hedge unnecessarily
- **Data-driven** — Always backs claims with specific numbers, never vague
- **Narrative-led** — Opens with stories from real (or realistic) conversations with GCs
- **Executive-peer tone** — Speaks as an equal to C-suite, not pitching up to them
- **Quietly authoritative** — Demonstrates expertise through specifics, never by claiming it

### Sentence-Level Patterns

- Short declarative sentences mixed with longer analytical ones
- Starts paragraphs with observations, not questions
- Uses dashes for asides — like this — rather than parentheses
- Specific numbers over approximations: "34% lower" not "significantly lower"
- Names roles specifically: "your VP of Claims" not "your team"
- Industry-specific language used naturally, never explained condescendingly

### What Wesley NEVER Sounds Like

- Motivational speaker ("Unlock your potential!", "The future is now!")
- LinkedIn influencer ("I'm excited to announce...", "Thrilled to share...")
- Consultant-speak ("Leverage synergies", "Drive alignment")
- Sales pitch ("Don't miss out!", "Limited time!", "Book a demo today!")

## Anti-AI Writing Patterns

These rules prevent content from reading like AI-generated text. **CRITICAL — apply to every draft.**

### Structure Anti-Patterns (NEVER do these)

- Never use bullet points as the primary structure of a LinkedIn post
- Never start with a question hook ("Ever wonder why...?", "What if I told you...?")
- Never use the "problem → agitate → solve" template overtly
- Never end with "What do you think?" or "Agree?"
- Never use emoji as bullet markers or section dividers
- Never list "3 things I learned" or "5 tips for..."
- Never start consecutive sentences with the same word
- Never use the word "landscape" to describe an industry
- Never say "game-changer," "deep dive," "unlock," "leverage," or "at the end of the day"

### Vocabulary Blacklist

These words/phrases instantly flag content as AI-generated. **Never use them:**

| Banned | Use Instead |
|--------|-------------|
| leverage | use, apply, build on |
| utilize | use |
| landscape | market, industry, space |
| game-changer | (describe the actual change) |
| deep dive | analysis, breakdown, look at |
| unlock | find, discover, get |
| harness | use, apply |
| navigate | handle, manage, work through |
| streamline | simplify, speed up, cut |
| at the end of the day | ultimately, the reality is |
| it's worth noting that | (just state it) |
| in today's [X] | (be specific about what's happening) |
| I'm excited to | (just say what happened) |
| thrilled to announce | (just announce it) |
| robust | strong, thorough, solid |
| seamless | smooth, easy, simple |
| cutting-edge | new, advanced, modern |
| holistic | complete, full, whole |
| synergy | (describe the actual benefit) |
| paradigm shift | (describe the actual change) |
| transformative | (show the transformation with data) |
| empower | help, enable, give |

### Authenticity Markers (DO include these)

- Reference specific conversations: "A GC at a Fortune 100 told me last week..."
- Include imperfect details: numbers that aren't round, timelines that aren't neat
- Show the "messy middle": "We thought X, but the data showed Y"
- Use industry shorthand naturally: "MDL," "reserve accuracy," "outside counsel management"
- Occasional incomplete thoughts that trail off with a dash —
- Specificity that only someone in the room would know
- References to the Litigation Sentinel newsletter as a natural extension of the conversation

### Post Opening Patterns That Work for Wesley

- Start with a specific data point: "Nuclear verdicts are up 28% since 2023."
- Start with an observation: "Every F500 GC I've talked to this quarter has the same problem."
- Start with a contrarian statement: "Litigation management is dead."
- Start with a specific moment: "Last Tuesday, a CLO showed me her portfolio dashboard."
- Start mid-thought: "The real risk isn't the headline number."

### Post Closing Patterns That Work for Wesley

- End with an insight, not a CTA: "The difference? They knew what they had before the first mediation."
- End with a quiet link to deeper content: "Full analysis in this week's Litigation Sentinel."
- End with a forward-looking statement: "This is what litigation intelligence looks like."
- End with a specific question to the RIGHT audience: "For GCs managing 500+ matters — what's your current blind spot?"
- NEVER end with: "Like and share if you agree!" or "Drop a comment below!"

## CaseGlide Content Pillars for LinkedIn

All LinkedIn content should map to one of these pillars:

1. **Nuclear Verdicts & Social Inflation** — Data, trends, state-specific analysis, what GCs need to know
2. **Litigation Intelligence vs. Management** — The paradigm CaseGlide is defining (intelligence > management)
3. **F500 Legal Department Operations** — Reserve accuracy, outside counsel management, portfolio visibility
4. **Industry-Specific Risk** — Insurance claims, product liability, employment litigation trends
5. **Technology & Legal Innovation** — AI in legal, data-driven defense, case outcome prediction
6. **CaseGlide Proof Points** — Client wins, platform capabilities, before/after comparisons (use "How I" framing)
