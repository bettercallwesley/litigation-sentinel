# LinkedIn Content Topic Priorities — CaseGlide

> Auto-loaded rule. Defines which topics to write about, ranked by proven performance and strategic importance.

## Topic Priority Rankings

Based on 6 months of LinkedIn post data (~50 posts analyzed) and Wesley's strategic priorities. Impressions noted where available; unlisted posts had ~1,000 or less.

### Tier 1: Proven Top Performers (prioritize weekly)

| Topic | Best Performance | Why It Works |
|-------|-----------------|--------------|
| **Judicial Hellholes & Venue Risk** | 55,000 impressions | ATRA report content + specific court data. The post with the Hellholes LIST image massively outperformed similar posts without the list. |
| **RICO & Legal System Abuse** | 10,000 impressions | Uber, FedEx, insurers, staged accidents. Ties legal system reform to data-driven defense. |
| **Morgan & Morgan / Plaintiff's Bar** | 10,000-15,000 impressions | John Morgan quotes, ad spend ($218M→$500M), "big game hunting," plaintiff tactics. Audiences are fascinated. |

### Tier 2: High Strategic Value (1-2x per week)

| Topic | Best Performance | Why It Works |
|-------|-----------------|--------------|
| **Nuclear Verdicts & Social Inflation** | 4,000+ impressions | Tesla $329M, data-heavy posts. Core CaseGlide authority topic. State-level data drives saves. |
| **Bill Review Bashing / Legacy vs Intelligence** | 6,000 impressions | "Bean counters" narrative. Calls out specific competitors. Resonates with frustrated claims leaders. |
| **AI in Litigation** | (new priority) | Court rulings on AI use, judge opinions, ethical guardrails. Emerging hot topic for 2026. |

### Tier 3: Supporting Content (1x per week, rotate)

| Topic | Notes |
|-------|-------|
| **Litigation Legislative Reform** | Tort reform bills, what data legislators need, FL reform story |
| **Litigation Finance & Funding** | Third-party funding disclosure, market growth, impact on case strategy |
| **Defense Attorney Advocacy** | Attorney satisfaction, broken incentives, "attorneys deserve better" |
| **CaseGlide Proof Points** | Client wins, before/after, platform integration stories |
| **F500 Legal Department Operations** | Outside counsel management, portfolio visibility, defense performance |
| **Humor & Memes** | 24,000 impressions for the cuffed pants post. High performer when done right. Use sparingly. |

## Topic-Specific Angles & Hooks

### Judicial Hellholes
- Reference the ATRA "Judicial Hellholes" report by name
- Include the actual list/ranking — the list image drove 55K impressions vs. ~1K without it
- Use the term "magic jurisdictions" (plaintiffs' bar insider language)
- Angle: "You can't always stay away, but you can stop flying blind"
- Data to include: venue-level cycle time, verdict severity, settlement deltas
- Always tie back to: "Build a venue-level view in one system"

### RICO Cases
- **Uber**: RICO suits in FL, CA, NY, Philadelphia — staged accident ecosystems (lawyers, doctors, funders)
- **FedEx**: Research and include current RICO developments
- **Insurers**: Construction carriers filing RICO against runner networks
- Angle: "The private sector is doing what the justice system won't: turning data into defense"
- Tie to: Rule 11 enforcement, MDL reform, "volume over validity"
- CaseGlide connection: Litigation Intelligence exposes the same patterns at scale

### Morgan & Morgan
- Quote John Morgan directly (PBD podcast is rich source material)
- Key quotes: "catching fish vs. cooking fish," "I'm not hunting cockroaches. I'm hunting big game."
- Ad spend trajectory: $218M (2024) → ~$500M (2027 target) = "8% of all legal advertising in the US"
- "When we pick juries, we want MAGA. They're mad. They're angry."
- Bad faith strategy: "When they come to offer me the million, it's too late."
- Angle: What the defense side needs to learn from M&M's dominance
- Always end with: "Is the Fortune 500 ready for what's next?"

### Nuclear Verdicts
- Reference Marathon Strategies data: 135 verdicts, $31.3B, 52% YoY growth
- State-level data from `src/data/nuclear-verdicts.ts`
- Tie to specific industries: trucking (ATRI), medical (Doctors Company), insurance (Swiss Re)
- Nuclear Verdict® is a registered trademark of Tyson & Mendes LLP — always attribute
- Angle: The real risk isn't the headline number — it's the data gaps between filing and first review

### AI in Litigation
- Court rulings restricting or requiring AI disclosure
- Judge opinions on AI-generated filings
- How defense teams should/shouldn't use AI
- CaseGlide's own AI (Case Clerk AI, Chambers, Chronicle) as examples of responsible legal AI
- Angle: AI is a tool, not a strategy — intelligence still requires human judgment

### Bill Review / Legacy Bashing
- Name competitors: "Bottomline-LegalX, TyMetrix, CounselLink, Mitratech"
- The "Bill Review Blind Spot": savings reports while spend skyrockets
- "Would you hire a contractor to build you a house and then refuse to pay for it when it's completed to perfection?"
- Angle: "Invoice edits and audits aren't strategy"
- Formula: "Legal Spend Data + Litigation Performance Data = Litigation Intelligence"

### Litigation Finance & Funding
- Third-party funding growth statistics
- Disclosure rule changes by state
- How outside funding changes case strategy and timeline
- Impact on settlement dynamics and defense approach

## Image Strategy

Based on post performance data:

- **List/ranking images** massively outperform generic images (55K impressions vs. ~1K for similar posts without)
- **Podcast thumbnails** work well for Morgan & Morgan content (15K impressions)
- **Memes and humor images** can drive massive engagement (24K for cuffed pants)
- **Product screenshots** (Case Updates, Dashboards) work for mid-funnel CaseGlide proof posts
- **AI-generated images** performed well for Morgan & Morgan ad spend post (10K)
- **Note**: "Several months ago posts with images would outperform posts without, but it seems that has shifted. There were exceptions." — Test both, but don't force an image if the text is strong enough on its own.

## Conference Calendar Awareness

Wesley posts ramp up around major industry conferences. Reference these when timely:
- **ITC** (InsurTech Connect)
